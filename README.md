# List BLE devices

List Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices using Bleak

Also, learned a little about how to decipher Python code as
I was having trouble understanding the BleakScanner. 

In particular I didn't find the [Bleak usage page](https://bleak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html)
very helpful. But with help from the [bot](https://chatgpt.com/share/6883df0e-f110-800c-a1c6-62dd00e00859)
I was able to get this working.

## Setup

I'm using Python 3.13 and Bleak 1.0.1 others may work
